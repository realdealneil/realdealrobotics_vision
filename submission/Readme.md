Run Real Deal Robotics' submission as follows:

python3 rdr_generate_submission.py -p <pathToImages>

where <pathToImages> is replaced with the actual path to the folder containing JPG test images.  

This should deconflict with whatever version of generate_submission.py
script is run by AlphaPilot.
